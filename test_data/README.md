# test_data

Sample datasets for trying `permucn` quickly.

- `toy_example/`: minimal input set, best for quick post-install validation.
- `polar_fish/`: larger and closer to practical usage, better for workflow and parameter checks.

Recommended usage:

- if you want a fast sanity check: `toy_example/`
- if you want a run closer to real data conditions: `polar_fish/`
